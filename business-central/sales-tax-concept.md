# <a name="sales-tax-in-the-default-version-of-business-central"></a>GST in the Default Version of Business Central

A **GST** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. GST, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but, generally speaking, business-to-business transactions are exempted from GST.  

Typically, GST applies to the retail sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting GST at the time of purchase.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries that use value-added tax (VAT) or that use GST. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for sales tax and richer support in the versions of the application used in the United States and Canada.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although GST is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of GST in Australia only.
