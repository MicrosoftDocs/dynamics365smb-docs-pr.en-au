# <a name="sales-tax-in-the-default-version-of-business-central"></a>GST in the Default Version of Business Central

A **GST*** is a tax that applies to the purchase of goods and services for consumers and to the sale of goods and services for businesses. GST, ideally, should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Exemptions in final consumptions depend on local authorities but generally speaking, business-to-business transactions should be exempted from GST.  

Typically, GST apply to the sale of goods and services and are a percentage of the total purchase amount. Retailers are responsible for calculating and collecting GST at the time a purchase is made.  

[!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] is available in countries that use GST and in countries that use sales tax. The default version of [!INCLUDE[prod_short](includes/prod_short.md)] has basic support for GST and richer support in the versions of the application are used in Australia.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Although GST is available in the default version, Microsoft supports the use of GST in Australia only.
