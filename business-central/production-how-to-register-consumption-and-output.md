title: Register Consumption and Output for One Production Order | Microsoft Docs
description: This execution task is performed in the **Production Journal** window. The journal combines the functions of the separate consumption journal and output journals into one journal. The combined journal is accessed directly from a released production order. Its main purpose is to manually post the consumption of components, the quantity of end items produced, and the time spent in operations.
