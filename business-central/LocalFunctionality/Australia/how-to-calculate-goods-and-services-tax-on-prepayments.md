When a partial payment or prepayment is made, you must calculate Goods and Services Tax (GST) for that partial payment or prepayment based on the total invoice amount, instead of on a partial amount. If you account for GST on a noncash basis, you must report and pay GST on payments during the period in which you receive partial payment or issue a tax invoice for payment.
