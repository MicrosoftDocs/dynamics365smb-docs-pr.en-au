title: Withholding Tax in the Australian version
description: In the Australian version, Withholding Tax (WHT) is tax withheld by a company when making a payment to a vendor, in which the full amount owed to that vendor is reduced by the tax withheld. The withheld tax is then remitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) during the next Business Activity Statement (BAS) submission.
