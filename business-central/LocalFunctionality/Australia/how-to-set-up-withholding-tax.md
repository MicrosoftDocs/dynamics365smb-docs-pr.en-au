title: How to Set Up Withholding Tax
description: Withholding tax (WHT) is the tax withheld by a company when it makes a payment to a vendor, in which the full amount owed to the vendor is reduced by the tax withheld. The withheld tax is then remitted to the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) when the next Business Activity Statement (BAS) is submitted.
