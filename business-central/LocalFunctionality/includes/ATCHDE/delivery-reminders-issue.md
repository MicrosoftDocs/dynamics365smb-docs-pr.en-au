After you create delivery reminders, you must issue and print them so that you can send reminders to vendors. Before you issue the delivery reminders, you can print a test report.  

When you issue the delivery reminders, delivery reminder ledger entries are created. You can view the created ledger entries on the **Deliv. Reminder Ledger Entries** page.  

## To issue delivery reminders  

1. Choose the ![Lightbulb that opens the Tell Me feature.](../../../media/ui-search/search_small.png "Tell me what you want to do") icon, enter **Delivery Reminder**, and then choose the related link.  
2. On the **Delivery Reminder** page, select the delivery reminder that you want to issue, and then choose the **Edit** action.  
3. Choose the **Issue** action.  
4. On the **Issue Delivery Reminder** page, fill in the fields as described in the following table.
